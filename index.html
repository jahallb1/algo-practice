    <h3>A Very Big Sum</h3>
    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>
      In this challenge, you are required to calculate and print the sum of the
      elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be
      quite large. Function Description Complete the aVeryBigSum function in the
      editor below. It must return the sum of all array elements. aVeryBigSum
      has the following parameter(s): int ar[n]: an array of integers . Return
      long: the sum of all array elements Input Format The first line of the
      input consists of an integer . The next line contains space-separated
      integers contained in the array. Output Format Return the integer sum of
      the elements in the array.
    </p>
    <h4>Answer</h4>

    <p>
      function aVeryBigSum(ar) { // cacluate all intergers in array let sum
      =ar.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); return sum; }
